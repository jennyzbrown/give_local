$1 is automatically donated to the charity and deducted from the user's account. The user's account reflects the donation and saves the cause to the user's profile page. The user's profile page also features a progress bar that reflects how close the user is to meeting the contribution goal he or she set:

Causes and charities add themselves to the database through a new form:

The functionality of the app works however the alpha version does not support the actual exchange of money. The accounts for both users and causes are placeholders.

Upcoming features include: geolocation of users and causes, integration of a payment and exchange infastructure.
